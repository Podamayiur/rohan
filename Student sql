1.Creating the "students" table

CREATE TABLE students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
  gender TEXT
);

2.Inserting three rows of data into the "students" table:

INSERT INTO students (name, age, gender) VALUES ('John', 20, 'Male');
INSERT INTO students (name, age, gender) VALUES ('Mary', 18, 'Female');
INSERT INTO students (name, age, gender) VALUES ('Bob', 22, 'Male');

3.Retrieving all rows from the "students" table:

SELECT * FROM students;

The result should be:

id  | name | age | gender
----|------|-----|-------
1   | John | 20  | Male
2   | Mary | 18  | Female
3   | Bob  | 22  | Male


4. Updating the name of the student with id = 2 to "Janet":

UPDATE students SET name = 'Janet' WHERE id = 2;

5.Deleting the row with id = 3 from the "students" table:

DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;

SELECT * FROM students;

Result:

id  | name  | age | gender
----|-------|-----|-------
1   | John  | 20  | Male
2   | Janet | 18  | Female
